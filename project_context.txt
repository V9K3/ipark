# iPark Project Context

## Game Rules
- 1x5 parking grid (horizontal row)
- Car pool always has enough seats for all passengers, and colors match
- Passengers board cars automatically; cars are removed when full
- Player can manually remove cars (limited removals per level)
- Win when all passengers are gone, parking grid and car pool are empty

## UI Structure
- Top: Passengers row with count
- HUD: Removals left, Wins
- Middle: Parking grid (1x5)
- Bottom: Vehicle grid (n x n, compact)
- Action button (Next Level/Restart) only shows on win/lose

## Implementation Notes
- Auto-boarding and auto-removal logic ensures win is always possible
- Debug output for win condition and state
- .gitignore is set up for Flutter best practices
- No persistent lines or progress bars in the UI
- All widgets are in `game_screen.dart`, `main.dart`, and `menu_screen.dart`
